:: Cheer Ep0 Sc8b
\
After a few seconds of futilely trying to rub yourself through your cage, you quickly grab your backpack and stash the uniform. Even if there’s only a slight chance it belongs to $guardian, you can’t bear to leave the uniform behind.

As you go back to sorting, you hear yelling come from out on the practice field. You scramble to the window and see the squad practicing cheers, chanting and dancing.

They’re just a little too far away for you to get a good look at the squad members, but that doesn’t stop your mind from filling in the blanks as you watch.  You know you should get to work, but maybe it wouldn’t hurt to stay at the window just a little longer.
