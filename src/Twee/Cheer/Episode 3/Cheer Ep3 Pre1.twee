You walk to school under a thick cover of grey clouds. Looks like the weatherman was wrong about it being a beautiful day today. Having left your umbrella at home, you decide to pick up the pace to beat the rain.

The gates of the school are in sight as you feel the first spit of wetness on your face. Dashing for the door, you manage to make it inside just before the rain starts to fall in earnest. You let out a sigh of relief and head for class, reminded about how you really should just keep an umbrella in your backpack.
