	You squeeze passed the mountainous bouncer, grip the silver handle in your trembling [, manicured] fingers and push on the blood red door. It’s heavier than you expected and a grunt of effort escapes your lips as you push all your weight against it /[if high fitness - even using all your new-found fitness from cheer training isn’t enough]/. 

	The bouncer smirks in your direction. @@.malevoice5;“Try pulling on it, girly…”@@, he says suggestively.

	Somewhat abashed, you pull the door towards you, half expecting it to squeak like they do in horror films. The door squeaks and it makes you jump.

	@@.malevoice5;“I told them to get some WD40!”@@

	Determined not to make a further fool of yourself, you step quickly through the door and pull it shut with a clunk.

	A spiral staircase leans down into the bowels of the building. You step down cautiously/[if heels - , your heels ringing on the bare stone,]/ and emerge into a small office space with a single doorway barring you from moving further. A statuesque blonde, dressed like a secretary - if secretaries only wore leather or latex - glares at you over her spectacles. Your eyes drink in every inch of her, from her luscious blonde hair, perfect, elegant makeup and amazing breasts. 

	@@.femvoice5;“I’m up here,”@@ she purrs, drawing your gaze back to her face. She purses her red lips at you, then parts them revealing a line of perfect white teeth, like a row of pearls.  @@.femvoice5;“Well, you made it down here, so I am guessing you told Dominic the password.”@@  The latex goddess stands and straightens her skirt, her hands pulling the material down over her latex stockings. She walks beside you, her heels making her several inches taller than you/if heels -, despite  your own heels]/.

	 She steps forward to a curtain and swishes it to one side revealing a list of rooms with nothing but a colour to distinguish them apart. 

	@@.femvoice5;“You may choose any you like, aside from the grey ones. Those are already… ahem… occupied.”@@

	@@.heroT;“Um, what…?”@@

	@@.femvoice5;“At-at!”@@ she says. @@.femvoice5;“Each room is unique. Pick one.”@@

	@@.heroT;“How m… m… much?”@@

	@@.femvoice5;“Tsk!”@@ she says, anger coating her tone. @@.femvoice5;“Nothing. If you paid to get down here, then the rooms are gratis. Now, no more questions. Pick one!”@@

	@@.malevoice5;“You know the drill, girly. Grip it between those slender fingers of yours and tug on it...”@@

	Blushing as you catch his meaning, you reach for the door handle, remembering to pull and not push. Unlike before, the door opens silently, gliding open silently like it’s floating in the vacuum of space. 

	The bouncer sneezes loudly, a booming sound which would drown out small cannon. @@.malevoice5;“Sorry, girly…”@@, he says, smirking in your direction.  

	You flash him a look of irritation, one you have seen $teacher use so often, and step quickly through the doorway. The bouncer closes the door behind you with a loud thump which echoes down the spiral staircase. You step down cautiously/[if heels - , your heels ringing on the bare stone,]/ and emerge into the small office space.

	The towering blonde secretary from before looks up at you with a knowing smile dancing on her luscious lips. Knowing your lesson from before, you do not openly stare at her amazing breasts and content yourself by stealing surreptitious glances.. 

	@@.femvoice5;“You again?”@@ she asks, climbing to her feet and reaching out to move the curtain with her cruelly-shaped talon fingernails. @@.femvoice5;“You must either be rich, or have a wealthy benefactor. Sugar-daddy perhaps, sending you here for lessons?”@@

	@@.heroT;“Um…”@@

	@@.femvoice5;“How precious! That was of course, rhetorical. I do not care as to the why or who or how. Now, pick one. And avoid the grey ones.@@

Without a further word the secretary opens the door and reveals a maze of corridors leading left, right and directly in front of you. The plink-plink of water dripping into a puddle echoes gently in the confines of the space. The arched ceiling is lit by red strip lights, the closest of which flickers menacingly. You think you can see someone - a girl maybe - walking in the distance but the flickering light makes it hard to tell. You draw a breath and begin the long walk, your clicking heels making you wobble precariously on the cobbled floor.
