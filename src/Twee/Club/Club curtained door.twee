Walking along one of the corridors you spy a grey curtain which is draped in front of an unremarkable piece of white wall. What further piques your curiosity is the towering man in a black dinner jacket, starched white dress shirt and black bowtie. Intrigued you hang back for a few minutes waiting to see if anything exciting happens. As you watch from along the corridor you notice the top of a stone arch peeking tantalisingly over the top of the curtain.

After several boring minutes, with club goers noisily walking passed, clutching drinks, or handbags or each other, you finally give in and approach the bouncer.

He watches you approach and you can feel yourself wilting under his gaze/[if heels - , even wobbling nervously on your heels]/. @@.malevoice5;”Password?”@@ He grunts when you get within hearing range.

@@.heroT;“Um,”@@ you say eloquently, wondering why you suddenly feel the need to use the restroom. @@.heroT;“Appeasement?”@@ you state hopefully.
	
You are rewarded with a deathly star which would rival Darth Vader on a bad hair day, only without the heavy breathing, and then a grunted @@.malevoice5;”Hmph!”@@. The bouncer reaches over and pulls the curtain to one side with the rasp of metal on metal as the rings slide along the bar. You gawp as the motion reveals a blood red door with silver fixtures.
